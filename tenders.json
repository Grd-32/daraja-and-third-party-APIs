Closing Date: 9 Dec 2024 The Millennium Water Alliance The Millennium Water Alliance (MWA) is a permanent global alliance of leading humanitarian and private organizations that convenes opportunities and partnerships, accelerates learning and effective models, and influences the WASH space by leveraging the expertise and reach of its members and partners to scale quality for sustained WASH services. Founded in the year 2002, MWA seeks to advance high standards for program quality, transparency and accountability and work with its members, governments, communities, private sector partners and other key stakeholders to bring to scale effective and sustainable water, sanitation, and hygiene education solutions. The Resilience Think and Do Tank Program The Resilience Think and Do Tank is a hub that is funded by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Kenya and provides technical support to stimulate dialogue and coordinated action along selected value chains, fostering idea generation and engagement through diverse events. It aims to boost the private sector, particularly farmers and MSMEs, towards sustainable agrifood systems by offering evidence-based insights for investments in the sector and establishing brokerage platforms for linking supply and demand, and investors and financing. Additionally, the hub enhances coordination among development partners and the Kenyan government, builds county level capacities for analytics and adaptive management, and employs Social Accountability methodologies. The goal is to drive economic growth through increased private sector development, ending extreme poverty, and achieving sustainable development. Rationale Despite increased interest and investments by government, development partners, and the private sector, the ASALs still grapple with a lack of consolidated, verifiable, and reliable data and information for investment decisions. The African Enterprise Challenge Fund (AECF) highlights that the lack of robust evidence proving commercial viability in ASALs is a significant barrier to attracting investment. The ASALs Policy 2012 also acknowledges that the lack of reliable data on resources and economic potential is a significant hurdle to ASALs development. Data is critical to investments decision as summarized below: Risk Assessment: Investors need reliable data to assess risks accurately. Without appropriate information, they cannot gauge the potential returns, or the risks involved, making them hesitant to invest. Resource Allocation: Insufficient data leads to poor resource allocation. Investors and policymakers cannot make informed decisions about where to allocate resources for maximum impact. Awareness and Expertise: A lack of information results in low awareness of opportunities and fails to attract expertise to the region who can address specific climate-related risks and enhance resilience. Resource Management: Effective management of natural resources, such as water and land, requires reliable data. In ASALs, the scarcity of data hampers efforts to sustainably manage these critical resources. Strategic Planning: Effective strategic planning particularly by county governments requires comprehensive data. Without it, developing and implementing effective adaptation and resilience strategies become challenging. For county and national governments, tracking progress towards sustainable development goals is also difficult without consistent and comprehensive data, making it hard to measure the impact of interventions and adjust strategies accordingly. Making consolidated, verifiable, and reliable data and information available to the private sector, development partners, county and national governments, among other stakeholders will contribute immensely to resilience, stability, and sustainable developments in the ASALs. This consultancy wants to consolidate information that would direct investors towards areas of the value chains with investment potentials. As a historically marginalised region and the need to build confidence among investors regarding the investment potential of the ASALs, there is need to produce investment opportunity profiles highlighting the regions untapped potential, favourable investment environment, and the potential impact of social investments especially in the agrifood, water, and energy sectors. Synthesized information highlighting (i) areas of promising investments on the basis of past, current and future trends, (ii) production and marketing statistics, (iii) potential return on investments, (iv) successful case studies and business cases, (v) existing financial and business development services, (vi) pricing models, (vii) status of infrastructure, enabling policies, security, etc, among others are necessary. The outputs of this consultancy will be central to the implementation of the Resilience Think and Do Tank activities on convening and connecting partnerships and investment opportunities. The aforementioned challenges justify the programs approach to contribute to resilience, stability, and sustainable developments in the ASALs through research and making data and information on investment opportunities in agrifood, water, and energy available.
